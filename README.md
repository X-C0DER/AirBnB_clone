AirBnB Clone Project
This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integrationâ€¦

Project Description
The project involves creating an AirBnB clone, a web application for property rentals. In its initial phase, a command interpreter is being developed to manage AirBnB objects, allowing users to create, retrieve, modify, and delete objects related to the AirBnB platform.
